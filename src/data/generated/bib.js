        "abstract": "In fruit production, bloom intensity estimation, i.e., the number of flowers present in an orchard, guides the process of pruning and thinning, which directly impact fruit yield and quality. This paper proposes an automated apple, peach, and pear flower detection method under varied environments. The semantic segmentation network DeepLab-ResNet is fine-tuned using an apple flower dataset and used in detection for apple, peach, and pear flower datasets. On the assumption that the network can roughly locate the flower object and there is a distinct color difference between the flower and the surrounding background, an active contour model is used to refine the coarse segmentation results of the network. Our method achieves an F1 score at pixel-level up to 89.6% on one of the apple datasets and an average F1 score of 80.9% on the peach, pear, and another apple datasets, which are 6% and 5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art region growing refinement method on the same datasets, respectively.",

In this paper, the segmentation and classification of leaf images with a complicated background using deep learning are studied. First, more than 2500 leaf images with a complicated background are collected and artificially labeled with target pixels and background pixels. The results show that the average Misclassification Error (ME) of 80 test images using Mask R-CNN is 1.15%. The average accuracy value for the leaf classification of 150 test images using VGG16 is up to 91.5%. This indicates that these methods can be used to segment and classify the leaf image with a complicated background effectively.",

However, traditional image-processing methods are sensitive to light intensity, and feature-extraction methods are complex and unstable, which are not suitable for pod multi-classification tasks. Therefore, a new classification method based on the number of effective and abortive seeds in soybean pods is proposed in this paper, and the non-maximum suppression parameters are adjusted. Experimental results show that our algorithm can quickly and accurately achieve the high-throughput counting of pods and seeds, improving the efficiency of indoor seed testing of soybeans.",
